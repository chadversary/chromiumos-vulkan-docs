Lots to say here...

TODO: Maybe move this discussion material to a Google doc until it's finalized?

Rough Goals:
    - Support importing dma_bufs as VkDeviceMemory.
    - Just as VkDeviceMemory and VkImage are decoupled in the core Vulkan API,
      preserve the decoupling for external VkDeviceMemory and external VkImage
      also.
    - Support creation of VkImages using VkImageCreateInfo extended with DRM
      modifiers. This keeps information such as tiling and compression formats
      explicit.
    - Support creation of external VkImages that have driver-private auxiliary
      memory in addition to the usual primary image memory. Compressed color
      images often require this.
    - Support binding VkImages to dma_buf-imported VkDeviceMemory.
    - Permit the sharing of external mipmapped, array, and multisample images
      in the API; even if the current extensions don't specify and/or allow it.
      We don't need to define all the rules right now for sharing complex
      images; but we should design an API that allows it when we're eventually
      ready to define those rules.
    - Support sharing VkImages between a fixed producer/consumer pair. The
      obvious use case is compositor and client.
    - Support sharing VkImages among multiple consumers and producers, such as
      in a star toplogy.
    - Require that any moment there must exist exactly one owner of the
      external image. Only the owner may read and write the image.
