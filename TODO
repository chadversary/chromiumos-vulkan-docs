- Discuss the big picture. What is flow between the KMS, gbm, Vulkan, Chromium
  OS's Ozone compositor?

- In transition from external layout to non-external layout, allow user to
  indicate if content should be preserved or invalidated, similar to how
  VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED and VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED are used in core
  Vulkan. This requires a rework of VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DRM_EXTERNAL_CHROMIUM.
