Description

    TODO:
        - Discuss usage.
        - Define semantics of acquire/release ownership transitions for external images.
        - Discuss suggested usage of semaphores and image memory barriers
          during ownership transitions.
        - Discuss relationship to VK_CHROMIUM_dma_buf_memory_import.
        - Discuss relationship with external semaphores, which are not defined
          by this extension.

Issues

    0. Needed work:

        - Define semantics for acquire/release.
        - Layout transitions for acquire/release?
        - Discuss how a layered extension may define the source and target of
          acquire and release.

    1. How does the application determine valid values for VkImageCreateInfo
       that can be paired with the dma_buf-imported VkDeviceMemory?

       Proposed Solution: This topic is sufficiently complex that it lies
       outside the scope of this extension. Implementations are encouraged to
       solve this issue with layered extensions or with additional APIs and
       protocols outside Vulkan.

    2. What about planar formats?

       Proposed Solution: Defer it to a future extension.

    3. How does the user determine which physical devices and queue families
       are capable of acquiring and releasing ownership of specific external
       images and/or external image layouts?

       TBD.

       Proposed Solution: Defer it to a future extension. On systems that lack
       such an extension, permit implicitly defined system-specific behavior.

    4. Should this extension be merged with
       VK_CHROMIUM_drm_external_image_format_properties?

       UNRESOLVED. The two extensions are so closely related that a merger
       feels natural. The Vulkan 1.0.32 spec, however, recommends they be kept
       separate.

       From the Vulkan 1.0.32 spec:

           For a set of global functionality that provides new instance-level
           and device-level commands, and can be enabled for a subset of
           devices, it is recommended that the functionality be partitioned
           across two extensions—one for the instance-level functionality, and
           one for the device-specific functionality. In this latter case, it
           is generally recommended that the two extensions have unique names.
