== Vulkan on Chromium OS ==

Documentation, extensions, and example code for enabling Vulkan in Chromium OS.

This is an early work-in-progress. Beware of dragons lurking in the dark.

You may want to start by reading NOTES.txt and the code in the 'examples'
directory. The example code is better documented than the extension specs
currently.

Don't hesistate to file issues against this repo.

TODO(chadv): Maybe move this discussion material to a Google doc until it's finalized?
